# ProbeKit
A repo that serves as a learning project for myself learning C and Windows Internals



Phase 1: Foundation and Basic Tool Development

    Learn C Fundamentals:
        Basics of C (variables, loops, functions, etc.).
        File operations, memory management, and system calls.

    Basic System Analysis Tool:
        Develop a simple tool in C to gather system information (OS version, installed security tools, running processes, etc.).
        Learn to interact with Windows APIs.

    Basic Malware Simulation:
        Create a simple "mock malware" program (e.g., file creation/deletion, registry modifications) to understand how malware might operate.

Phase 2: Intermediate Evasion Techniques and Analysis

    Dynamic Hooking Introduction:
        Implement basic API hooking to monitor system calls.
        Use this to understand how malware might intercept or modify system behavior.

    Evasion Technique Implementation:
        Start implementing basic evasion techniques (e.g., code obfuscation, process injection).
        Test these techniques against your system analysis tool and possibly against a sandboxed EDR solution.

    Intermediate Malware Framework:
        Expand your mock malware to include the evasion techniques you've learned.
        Simulate network communication or keylogging in a controlled environment.

Phase 3: Advanced Analysis and Malware Simulation

    Advanced Evasion and Rootkit Basics:
        Dive into more sophisticated evasion techniques (e.g., rootkits, kernel exploits).
        Start with user-mode rootkits and gradually explore kernel-mode.

    Comprehensive Security Analysis Toolkit:
        Enhance your system analysis tool to detect advanced evasion techniques and rootkit-like activities.
        Implement automated scripts to simulate various attack scenarios and record the system's response.

    Malware Framework Expansion:
        Integrate advanced features into your malware simulation (e.g., stealth, persistence).
        Focus on how it can be detected, and simulate defensive responses.

Phase 4: Full-Scale Simulation and Mitigation

    Full-System Evasion Testing:
        Combine all the evasion techniques you've learned and test them against robust security solutions.
        Analyze the results to understand the effectiveness of different techniques.

    Comprehensive Malware and Rootkit Framework:
        Develop a sophisticated simulation that combines various malware and rootkit behaviors.
        Ensure it's done ethically and safely, focusing on learning and defense.

    Mitigation and Defense Development:
        Based on your findings, develop strategies and methods to mitigate the attack vectors you simulated.
        Implement these mitigations in your analysis toolkit.

    Documentation and Reporting:
        Document all your findings, methodologies, and the effectiveness of different techniques.
        Create a reporting module in your toolkit to summarize the system's vulnerabilities and suggested defenses.

Final Phase: Refinement and Real-World Application

    Toolset Refinement:
        Refine your tools for ease of use, efficiency, and accuracy.
        Ensure your project adheres to ethical guidelines and legal boundaries.

    Real-World Testing:
        If possible, apply your toolkit in a controlled, real-world environment to test its practicality.
        Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

    Continuous Learning and Updating:
        As you grow in your role, continuously update your project with new techniques and findings.
        Use this project as a platform for ongoing learning and professional development.
